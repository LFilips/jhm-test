   * At times you require the test to burn some of the cycles doing nothing.

   *
   * For these occasions, we have the infrastructure support. Blackholes
   * can not only consume the values, but also the time! Run this test
   * to get familiar with this part of JMH.

   * within the testing code, and propagating blackholes is tedious).
