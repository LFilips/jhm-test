   * to forcefully interrupt the benchmark thread. JMH tries to do that
   * when it is arguably sure it would not affect the measurement.

  /*
   * In this example, we want to measure the simple performance characteristics
   * of the ArrayBlockingQueue. Unfortunately, doing that without a harness
   * support will deadlock one of the threads, because the executions of
   * take/put are not paired perfectly. Fortunately for us, both methods react
   * to interrupts well, and therefore we can rely on JMH to terminate the
   * measurement for us. JMH will notify users about the interrupt actions
   * nevertheless, so users can see if those interrupts affected the measurement.
   * JMH will start issuing interrupts after the default or user-specified timeout
   * had been reached.
   *
   * This is a variant of org.openjdk.jmh.samples.JMHScalaSample_18_Control, but without
   * the explicit control objects. This example is suitable for the methods which
   * react to interrupts gracefully.
