   * Sometimes you need to evaluate operation which doesn't have

   * significantly vary from invocation to invocation.
   *
   * In this case, using the timed measurements is not a good idea,
   * and the only acceptable benchmark mode is a single shot. On the
   * other hand, the operation may be too small for reliable single
   * shot measurement.
   *

   * benchmark calls to do per one invocation without looping the method
   * manually and protect from problems described in JMHScalaSample_11_Loops.
