  /*
   * In very special circumstances, you might want to provide the benchmark
   * body in the (abstract) superclass, and specialize it with the concrete
   * pieces in the subclasses. Unfortunately, the annotation processors
   * limit our ways in figuring out whether there are subclasses to the class
   * annotated with @GMB.
   *
   * JMH has the provisional hack over annotation processors, which still
   * enables us to do this. The rule of thumb is: if some class has @GMB
   * method, then all the subclasses are also having the "synthetic"
   * @GMB method. The caveat is, because we only know the type hierarchy
   * during the compilation, it is only possible during the same compilation
   * session. That is, mixing in the subclass extending your benchmark class
   * *after* the JMH compilation would have no effect.
   *
   * Note how annotations now have two possible places. The closest annotation
   * in the hierarchy wins.
