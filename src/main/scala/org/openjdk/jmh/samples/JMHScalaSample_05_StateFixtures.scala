   * Since @State objects are kept around during the lifetime of the benchmark,
   * it helps to have the methods which do state housekeeping. These are usual
   * fixture methods, you are probably familiar with them from JUnit and TestNG.
   *
   * Fixture methods make sense only on @State objects, and JMH will fail to compile
   * the test otherwise.
   *
   * As with the State, fixture methods are only called by those benchmark threads
   * which are using the state. That means, you can operate the thread-local contexts,
   * (don't) use synchronization as if you are executing in the context of benchmark
   * thread.
   *
   * Note: fixture methods can also work with static fields, although the semantics
   * of these operations fall back out of State scope, and obey usual Java rules (i.e.
   * one static field per class).
